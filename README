# Semantic NOPs

Part of my thesis for generating and finding semantic NOPs with the GNU binutils.

Database is currently in *Semantic-NOPS.csv*. Fields are separated with a '|'
character.  Semantic-NOPs which use more than one instruction have a prefix and
a suffix.  More NOPs can be placed in between the prefix and suffix.


Field 1: Architecture
Field 2: Prefix instructions (semicolon separated if more than one)
Field 3: Suffix instructions (semicolon separated if more than one)
Field 4: Prefix bytecode
Field 5: Suffix bytecode
